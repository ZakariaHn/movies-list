                Paul Thomas Anderson's "The Master" is fabulously well-acted and
                crafted, but when I reach for it, my hand closes on air. It has
                rich material and isn't clear what it thinks about it. It has
                two performances of Oscar caliber, but do they connect? Its
                title character is transparently inspired by L. Ron Hubbard, the
                founder of Scientology, but it sidesteps any firm vision of the
                cult religion itself — or what it grew into <br /><br />
                The Hubbard character, named Lancaster Dodd and played by Philip
                Seymour Hoffman, is indeed not even the film's most important.
                Top billing goes to an alcoholic adherent of The Master named
                Freddie Quell — played by Joaquin Phoenix, who in some ways
                seems to flow out of the bizarre persona he created during his
                meltdown, or whatever it was, two years ago.
